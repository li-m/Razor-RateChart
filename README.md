RazorRateChart
==============
This project is a Razor V3 website that realize the same functionality as the RateChart project: allow user to define two date in the input, then query the database and display EURUSD rate chart within the corresponding period.

This is much easier to implement as ASP.NET itself is equipped with Chart Helper.
